summary: Match tiles and clear the board
description: |
  A solitaire version of the classic Eastern tile game. Tiles are stacked on
  the board at the start of the game. The goal is to remove all the tiles in
  as little time as possible. Select two matching tiles and they will disappear
  from the board, but you can only select a tile if there is an empty space to
  its left or right at the same level. Be careful: tiles that look alike
  may actually be slightly different.

  GNOME Mahjongg features a variety of starting layouts, some easy and some
  difficult. If you get stuck, you can ask for a hint, but this adds a large
  time penalty.
